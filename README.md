onPHP Inception
====
**onPHP Inception** is a onPHP sub-framework design for rapid development of CRUD-heavy applications. It's facilities allow
to implement full CRUD functionality for an entity in 5 to 15 minutes.

On the other hand, most of it's functionality is completely optional. So, if you have a complex application with some need for CRUD
and you want to save time writing dull and repetitive code for creating, reading, updating and deleting entities,
this project might prove to be handy to you.

Most of sub-framework's facilities are located in classes under **'classes/Inception/'** directory.  
Testing facilities are located in classes under **'tests/'** directory.  

You should explore those classes to fully grasp all of the **onPHP Inception** functionality.
