onPHP Inception
====
onPHP Inception is a onPHP sub-framework design for rapid development of CRUD-heavy applications. It's facilities allow
to implement full CRUD functionality for an entity in 5 to 15 minutes.

On the other hand, most of it's functionality is completely optional. So, if you have a complex application with some need for CRUD
and you want to save time writhing dull and repetitive code for creating, reading, updating and deleting entities,
this project might prove to be handy to you.
